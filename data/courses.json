What do superhero stories tell us about ourselves? These questions serve the two primary goals of the course. First, to become familiar with the characteristics of the superhero narrative by engaging with and writing about a variety of literary and popular texts, tracing the figure of the superhero in narratives across an array of genres, from the novels and pulp fiction of the early twentieth century to the transmedia empires of today. Second, to explore some of the cultural issues and rhetorical functions communicated through and served by superhero narratives, particularly with respect to what they reveal about ideas like justice, power, and identity and issues of race, class, and gender.",
